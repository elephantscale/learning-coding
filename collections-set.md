## Medium (B)

### Working with 2 sets

#### B1 - create two sets
```
a = {10,20,30,40}
b = {10,15,30}
```
Find common elements in set `a` and `b`

#### B2 - find only elements in set `a` and not in `b`

#### B3 - find union of set `a` and `b`

#### B4 - de-dupe
- Create a list of 50 random numbers between 1 and 100 (including).  
- print only unique numbers from the list, eliminating duplicates
