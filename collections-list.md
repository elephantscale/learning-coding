# Collections / List

## Solutions
* [Python](answers/python/collections-list-solution.ipynb)

## Easy

* A1 - Create a list of 10,20,30,40,50
* A2 - Append 60 to the end of list
* A3 - insert 5 at the front of list
* A4 - insert 15 at position 2 (between 10,20)
* A5 - iterate over the list and print one per line
* A6 - print first element in list
* A7 - print last element in list
* A8 - print elements 2-4
* A9 - print all elements starting with index 3
* A10 - print last 3 from second last
* A11 - copy the list into another
* A12 - delete the last element from the copied list,  print both to make sure you really have a copy
* A13 - create another list with 10,3,4,15,20,5
* A14 - sort this list, is the original list changed?
* A15 - Create a list as follows  
a = [7,3,5,6,10,11,23]
  - print all elements less than 10
  - instead of printing create another list

## Medium
### B1 - Two lists
a = [1,5,2,10,7,4,6]  
b = [1,4,3]  
* print all numbers common to a / b
* print all numbers unique to a (not in b)
* build another list (c) that has common elements


### B2 - Remove duplicates
a = [3,2,1,5,2,1,6,5]  
Remove duplicates from a

### B3 - generate a list of 10 random numbers between 1 to 100

### B4 - take sample from the following list
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

### B5 - shuffle a list
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

### B6 - Pick a random element from list
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

### B7 - iterate over two lists simultaneously.
x = [1,2,3,4]  
y = [a,b,c]  
output  
    1,a  
    2,b  
    3,c  
    4  

### B8 - convert a list of multiple integers into a single integer
Sample list: [11, 33, 50]  
Expected Output: 113350

## Hard
### C1 - List comprehension
a = [3,2,5,4,7,10]  
construct a list of even numbers from a
